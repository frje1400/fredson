A JSON parsers in pure Python. Developed for educational purposes only.
Passes an extensive test suite and should be fully compatible with Python's
built in JSON module (i.e. implementation defined behaviour should match 1:1).
Very slow however due to being implemented in Python only, and thus not suitable for
production workloads.
